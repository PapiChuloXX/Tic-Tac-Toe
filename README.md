# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Tic-Tac-Toe like the name implies is a spin off of the popular board game implemented in Python using the Tkinter Package

## This project was my very first GUI project, and I have always had the intention to integrate an AI model with the game, so as I'm still learning statiscal learning. The game will be improved soon enough.
